phpIPAM is a popular web based IP Address Management system
It incorporates functionality for a scan agent to be deployed remotely,
regularly scan subnets for active devices and maintain this information
in the central IPAM database.

This plugin allows you to run the phpIPAM scan agent directly on your
OPNsense firewall, saving the overhead of deploying additional resources
just to perform IP scans.
